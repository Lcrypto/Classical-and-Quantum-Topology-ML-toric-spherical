# Classical and Quantum Topology Machine Learning: SPHERICAL AND HYPERBOLIC TORIC TOPOLOGIES
The GitHub repositories referenced in this paper, titled “SPHERICAL AND HYPERBOLIC TORIC TOPOLOGY-BASED CODES ON GRAPH EMBEDDING FOR ISING MRF MODELS: CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM TOPOLOGY MACHINE LEARNING,” contain the source code related to the research. 


We utilize the Matlab platform described in the paper “Sparse factorization of square matrices with application to neural attention modeling” by Ruslan Khalitov, Tong Yu, Lei Cheng, and Zhirong Yang, published in Neural Networks, Volume 152, 2022, Pages 160-168, as the base platform for Non-parametric Sparse Factorisation in our work https://github.com/RuslanKhalitov/SparseFactorization.
